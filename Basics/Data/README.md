# Data

This folder is supposed to function as a collection of data handling and data acquisition methods. <br>

For any scraping methods, remember any changes in the websites' structure can result in the
functions not working anymore. Should anyone stumble across my functions and intend to use them one way or the othergit , please 
be aware that **they are not meant for frequent and repeated use** (e.g. in a loop)! :warning: :point_up: <br>
