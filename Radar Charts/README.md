# Radar charts

This directory contains 2 (3) options to create Radar charts. While radar charts undoutebly have their drawbacks [1, 2, 3], I find them to be a very cool (and at some stage trendy :laughing:) way to visualize basic performance and compare players superficially. <br>

I myself created a very basic function that can be used to create radar charts to prove to myself that I can do it :laughing:.
With the cool work done by other people, it seems somewhat pointless to spent hours and hours perfecting a function to do the same though. <br>

One of the cool options available online (*mplsoccer*) does not work for me at the moment. It seems to have something to do with the matplotlib version (docstring in specific).
Eitherway with *soccerplots* there is another cool options out there :clap:. <br>
